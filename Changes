Revision history for Perl utility program Inside.

0.07  Mon Dec  4
	- original version (with a Makefile.PL and all)
0.10  Thu Dec  7
	- Fixed missing backslash in regular expression, minor other
	  fixes. Added copyright notice to misc files.
0.11  Thu Dec  7
	- Fixed that missing backslash for real this time. It was being
	  unfixed by RCS, so many fixes for that. Adjusted the
	  top-of-program magic to (I hope) not make warnings. Added
	  local() to some uses of $^W.
